        <h4>National Economics Challenge • 4th Place National Finalist</h4>
        <p>We studied macroeconomics, microeconomics, foreign policy, and current events, and competed against teams from around the world.
          Alongside my duties as a competitor, I naturally fell into the leader of the team as my enthusiasm (this is exemplified through our ties which I convinced 
          our school to give us) for the material and guidance, introduced a study strategy that focused on dividing material among members to improve comprehension 
          and presentation skills, was unmatched. We were our school’s first-ever team to enter this competition, and now we’re turning our success into study 
          materials and a club to support future teams.
