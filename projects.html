          <h4>Pool Ladder Stopper</h4>
          <p>Our pool ladder kept on scraping the wall because our rubber stoppers would shrink and fall off.
            So, I 3D printed a different version to act as a more permanent fix.</p>

          <h4>Spring-powered Butterfly and Heart</h4>
          <p>I saw a video of rubber-band-powered butterflies flying out of a book. Trying to replicate it, 
            I designed 3D-printed, rubber-band powered spinning hearts. Using what I learned, I traced a monarch butterfly 
            on Fusion and combined it with the same spring mechanism to bring it to life.

          <h4>Piranha Plant Drain Cleaner</h4>
          <p>I 3D-Printed a drain cleaner to clean a shower in my house. As I used it, I thought it looked like a piranha plant
            so I designed a new one that did. I even made the stand a pipe so it looks like the video game.

          <h4>Recyclable Spool Container</h4>
          <p>One of the challenges made by Bambu Lab involved recycling, so I made lids to be able to recycle cardboard filament spools with center diameters of 82mm, 87mm, and 92mm</p>

          <h4>Tarot Card Case</h4>
          <p>My brother needed a card case for some cards he bought so I took some measurements and made him a box that fit perfectly and had designs on it.</p>

          <h4>Belt Clip</h4>
          <p>Being a skinny guy means that most of my pants and belts don't fit my waist, so I made this clip/buckle to hold a longer belt in place.</p>

          <h4>Luggage Tags</h4>
          <p>One of my friends lost track of his bag on a school competition. Luckily after about two hours of searching for the bag we found it at a restaurant we had eaten at.
            The owner couldn't contact us because he didn't have our information, so I just started 3D-printing luggage tags for people.

          <h4>Business Card</h4>
          <p>We made business cards which have our information on QR codes and NFC
            tags. Anytime someone wants to contact us they can just save our contact on their phone by scanning.
            It's cheaper, harder to lose, and proffesional.</p>

          <h4>Desk Organizer</h4>
          <p>My first 3D-printed project was a universal desk leveler. After several prototypes, we realized we were
          solving a problem that could be fixed just by loosening a screw or slipping in a piece of paper, so we 
          scrapped it. Still, the process taught me to enjoy researching, collecting data, and applying it toward 
          solutions.</p>

          <h4>Leaf Net</h4>
          <p>Because of expensive landscaping fees, communal discontent, and lack of municipal help, banyan trees and their leaves created a big issue in my neighborhood.
            So, I decided on making a product that would solve it. I came up with a net that has a hole in the center which when lifts up and acts as a funnel into a garbage bag.
            This tackled the problem of collection. By adding grass clippings and water I transform them into fertilizer. But this process of disposal is difficult
            as it requires a lot of space to store the bags while they ferment.

          <h4>Heart Lithophane</h4>
          <p>3D printing makes creating gifts easy. After gifting my mom, dad, and brother some heart lithophanes with special pictures, I have been asked by extended family to make
            them their own lithophanes as they love how they come out.

          <h4>Cross Bookmark</h4>
          <p>After my dad gave me books like <u>The Intelligent Investor</u>, <u>One up on Wall Street</u>, and <u>High Returns from Low Risk</u> I started reading more.
          Leading me to come up with a bookmark in the form of a cross.</p>
